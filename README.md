# Eikonal Equation Solver

This repository presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and DeepONets for solving the Eikonal equation. Both models have been adapted and implemented to address this specific problem.

The proposed architectures and training methodologies are based on the research outlined in the following publications:
